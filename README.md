# Crystal Collector

This game uses just jQuery and HTML. The user clicks on any of the four crystals which, each have a random, hidden value on page load. 
Clicking on the cyrstal adds points to the user's score. The user's goal is to match their score with the 
number presented on the screen. When the user matches the number exactly, they win and if the user goes over the number present they lose. 
Each time the player wins or loses the game is automatically reset.
